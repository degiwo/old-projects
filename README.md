# edar

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of edar is to provide easy to use functions for explorative
data analysis with R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of edar like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("degiwo/edar")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the package:

``` r
library(edar)
edar()
#> Package 'edar' is loaded.
```

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.
